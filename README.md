For the DataEngineer.io bootcamp Capstone Project, I'd like to create an End to End Data Pipeline focused on respiratory illnesses and their prevalence in the US.  The purpose of the pipeline would be to collect, transform and load a database to construct analytical (Tableau) dashboards on the transmission rates of common respiratory infections such as Covid, Influenza and RSV.

I have yet to find the data sources yet, but I would try to find some sort of live or semi-live data stream that could provide anonymized clinical test results of Influenza, Covid and RSV infections.  I'd try to find at least 2 different data live stream sources and use python/pandas to do EDA on the data.  I'd try to use Flink to live stream the data and a relational database to store the information (either postgres or mysql).
